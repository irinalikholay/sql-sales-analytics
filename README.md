## Step 1. Business Context

This project analyzes sales order data using SQL to answer key business questions.

The main goals of the analysis are:
- Understand overall sales performance
- Calculate core sales metrics such as total revenue and average order value 
- Explore how orders and revenue change over time
- Identify potential anomalies in daily sales

The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a transactional orders dataset.

## Step 2. Data Setup & Database Creation 

In this step , the raw sales data was prepared and loaded into a SQLite database.

Actions performed:
- A CSV file containing raw order data was added to the project.
- A SQLite database was created as a single "db" file.
- An "orders" table was defined with appropriate data types.
- The CSV data was imported into the database.

This step establishes the data foundation required for further SQL analysis.

## Step 3. Core Sales Metrics in SQL

In this step, basic sales metrics were calculated using SQL quaries.

The following metrics were analyzed:
- Total number of orders.
- total revenue.
- Average Order Value (AOV).
- Daily revenue trends.
- Revenue by products.

SQL aggregation functions such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG were used, along with GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to analyze the data from different business perspectives.

## Step 4. Business Insights

The analysis shows that revenue is highly concentrated in a single product category.

Phone is the top-performing product both in terms of total revenue and number of orders.
This indicates that its leadership is driven by strong and consistent customerdemand, not only by higher prices.

While this makes Phone the main growth driver, it also introduces business risk, as the company becomes highly dependent on one product category.

## Step 5. Time-Based Revenue Analysis

In this step, daily revenue dynamics were analyzed to understand business stability and revenue volatility over time.

# Daily revenue agregation 
Revenue was aggregated by order date using SQL 'GROUP BY order_date', allowing one row per day.

# Key metrics identified
- Minimum daily revenue : 98
- Maximus daily revenue : 11,475
- Average daily revenue : ~ 3,036
- Median daily revenue : 2,540

# Distribution analysis 
The average daily revenue is noticeable higher than the median , indicating a right-skewed distribution.
This means that while most days generate moderate revenue (around 2,500), several high-revenue days significantly increase the overall average.

## Business insight
The company demonstrates revenue volatility with occasional high-performance days. 

Relying solely on average daily revenue may overestimate typical daily performance. The median provides a more realistic view of a standart operating day.

This analysis highlights the importance of eevaluating distribution shape, not only summary metrics, when assessing business stability.

## Step 6. Monthly revenue analysis

# What was done
- Aggregated revenue on a monthly level.
- Evaluated year-over-year trend.
- Identified seasonality patterns.
- Determined strongest and weakest month.

# Key findings
- Dataset covers 24 months (2 years).
- Revenue remains relatively stable.
- Clear seasonality observed.
- Strongest month : October.
- Weakest month : February.

# Step 7 — Customer Analysis

## Objective
Understand customer contribution to total revenue and check if the business depends heavily on a small number of clients.

## Analysis Performed
1. Total number of customers
2. Revenue per customer
3. Top 10 customers by revenue
4. Total company revenue
5. Revenue generated by top customer
6. Share of total revenue from top customer

## Key Findings
- Total customers: 1,168
- Top customer revenue: 12,277
- Total revenue: 2,210,051
- Top customer share ≈ 0.55%

The business is NOT dependent on a single client.
Revenue distribution is diversified across customers.

## Conclusion

The customer base is broad and relatively stable.
There is no extreme revenue concentration risk.

## Step 8 — Product Analysis

### What was analyzed

- Revenue share by product
- Average order value per product
- Monthly revenue trends

### Key Findings

- Phone generates ~36% of total revenue and is the main revenue driver.
- Revenue is distributed across five products with no extreme dependency.
- Monitor has the highest average order value.
- Phone leads due to higher sales volume.
- Moderate seasonal variation observed.
