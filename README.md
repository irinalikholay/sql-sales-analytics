## Step 1. Business Context

This project analyzes sales order data using SQL to answer key business questions.

The main goals of the analysis are:
- Understand overall sales performance
- Calculate core sales metrics such as total revenue and average order value 
- Explore how orders and revenue change over time
- Identify potential anomalies in daily sales

The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a transactional orders dataset.

## Step 2. Data Setup & Database Creation 

In this step , the raw sales data was prepared and loaded into a SQLite database.

Actions performed:
- A CSV file containing raw order data was added to the project.
- A SQLite database was created as a single "db" file.
- An "orders" table was defined with appropriate data types.
- The CSV data was imported into the database.

This step establishes the data foundation required for further SQL analysis.
